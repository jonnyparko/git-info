# how to setup new project
1. Setup repo in Github... name the repo something meaningful! :)
2. Go to where you want to save your workspace and do a 'git clone <repo url>'
3. Now setup the project as a remote repo by doing 'git remote add origin <repo url>'
4. Now add your files you want to commit for the first time 'git add .'
5. 'git push --set-upstream origin master'
6. All done, rejoice.
